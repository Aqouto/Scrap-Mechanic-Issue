I need to be able to change the effect of the sledgehammer so that it can actually deal damage to a Farmbot. Currently it does zero damage and i'd like support to help change the script. I'm only experimenting with lua so i'm not doing this to give mobs a weakness, i like to disassemble some code and write new code to see what i can do.
